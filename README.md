## 💡 What it does

Forza Horizon sends car telemetry over UDP, but Steam Input doesn't use the DualSense's **adaptive triggers**. This tiny app fills the gap:

- **Left trigger (brake)** — pushes back harder the more you press. Buzzes like ABS when tires slip. Extra resistance when handbraking.
- **Right trigger (throttle)** — soft progressive resistance. Thumps on gear shifts. Buzzes at the rev limiter.

### How it talks to your controller without fighting Steam

```
┌──────────────────┐    UDP 5300     ┌──────────────────┐    HID write    ┌─────────────┐
│  Forza Horizon   │ ──────────────► │  This app        │ ──────────────► │  DualSense  │
│  (Data Out)      │  telemetry      │  (trigger bits   │  triggers only  │  controller │
└──────────────────┘  324 bytes      │   only)          │                 └─────────────┘
                                     └──────────────────┘                        ▲
                                                                                 │
                                     ┌──────────────────┐    HID write           │
                                     │  Steam Input     │ ──────────────────────►│
                                     │  (rumble bits)   │  rumble + buttons      │
                                     └──────────────────┘
```

Both the app and Steam write to the same controller — but they touch **different bytes**:

- Steam owns the **rumble motors** and button mapping.
- This app only flips the **adaptive trigger** bits (`valid_flag0` bits `0x04` and `0x08`).
- The HID device is opened in **non-blocking mode**, so writes fire immediately instead of waiting on the controller. Nothing gets queued, nothing blocks Steam.

That's why you can run both at the same time and neither one breaks the other.

## 🛠️ Install

**You need:** Windows 10/11 or Linux, and a DualSense controller (USB or Bluetooth).

### Install as a `uv` tool (easiest)

This puts an `fhds` command on your PATH:

```powershell
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python"
fhds
```

Pin a specific version by appending `@vX.Y.Z` to the URL, or download the
`fhds-*.whl` from the [latest release](https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python/releases/latest)
and `uv tool install <file>`.

### From source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python
cd Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python
uv run python -m fhds.main
```

Or `uv tool install .` from the same folder to install the local checkout.

Need `uv`? `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"` (Windows) or see [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv/).

> **Linux extras:** install `libhidapi` (`sudo apt install libhidapi-hidraw0` / `sudo pacman -S hidapi` / `sudo dnf install hidapi`) and the udev rule from `packaging/linux/70-dualsense.rules`. Then unplug/replug the controller once.
>
> **Wayland tray:** the minimize-to-tray icon needs the appindicator backend (X11 doesn't). Install these so PyGObject can build into the venv:
> - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config python3-dev libcairo2-dev libgirepository-2.0-dev libayatana-appindicator3-1 gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1`
> - Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel cairo gobject-introspection libayatana-appindicator`
> - Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc pkg-config python3-devel cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel libayatana-appindicator-gtk3`

### 🎮 Playing with SISR (Xbox App / Windows Store users)

If you are playing the game via the Xbox App or Microsoft Store, you will need a tool that makes the game recognize your controller as an Xbox controller. One option is **[SISR (Steam Input System Redirector)](https://github.com/Alia5/SISR)** — it redirects Steam Input to the system level and emulates a real Xbox controller, so it works even with Windows Store apps and anti-cheat-protected games.

Because SISR routes the controller through **Steam Input**, Steam can grab the physical DualSense exclusively and prevent this app from connecting. To avoid this, **you must start the programs in this exact order**:

1. **First, launch THIS APP** and wait for the short pulse on the triggers.
2. **Second, launch SISR** (and Steam).
3. **Finally, launch Forza Horizon.**

*(Note: If your controller disconnects while playing, close SISR, restart this app, then open SISR again. For SISR setup and emulation options, see the [SISR README](https://github.com/Alia5/SISR).)*

<details>
<summary>Manual install (for developers)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python
cd Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python
uv sync
uv run python -m fhds.main
```

Need `uv`? `pip install uv` or [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv/).

## 🎯 In-game setup

In Forza Horizon, open **Settings → HUD and Gameplay** and scroll to the bottom:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Data Out | **ON** |
| Data Out IP Address | **127.0.0.1** |
| Data Out IP Port | **5300** |

> [!NOTE]
> In some versions of Forza, entering `127.0.0.1` as the IP address may not work. If the application doesn't receive telemetry, try entering `::1` (IPv6 loopback) instead.

## 🔊 Enable Steam Haptics

**Steam** can vibrate the left and right rumble motors on your DualSense controller. To enable them:

### In Steam:
1. Right-click **Forza Horizon** in your library → **Properties**.
2. Go to **Controller → Additional Settings**.
3. Make sure **DualSense vibration** is turned **ON**.

### In-game (Forza Horizon):
1. Open **Settings → Advanced Controls**.
2. Find the **Vibration** option and enable it.

### DualSense software:
For best results, install the official **PlayStation® Accessories** software:
- Download: [PlayStation® Accessories](https://fwupdater.dl.playstation.net/fwupdater/PlayStationAccessoriesInstaller.exe)

This ensures your DualSense firmware is up to date for windows.

> ℹ️ **About Adaptive Triggers:** Steam doesn't support DualSense adaptive triggers for this game. That's what **this app** does — it adds realistic trigger feedback (brake resistance, engine feedback, ABS pulses, gear thumps, rev limiter buzz) on top of the rumble that Steam provides.

---

## ▶️ Run it

Run **`fhds`** (if installed as a tool) — or from source, `uv run python -m fhds.main`.

You'll feel a short pulse on both triggers — that means it's working. Now launch Forza Horizon and drive.

> Start the app **before** Forza Horizon. If you use HidHide, allowlist `python.exe`.

---

## 🎮 Auto-launch with Steam

Want the triggers to turn on automatically when you press **Play**? Tell Steam to run the app first.
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Sometimes auto-launching this way can cause issues with the application. For the most stable experience, it is recommended to launch the app manually first.

1. In Steam, right-click **Forza Horizon** → **Properties**.
2. Open the **General** tab and find **Launch Options**.
3. Point Steam at the app, then chain the game (`fhds.exe` lives in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` after `uv tool install`):

   ```text
   cmd /c "start "" "%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\fhds.exe"" && %command%
   ```

That's it. Press **Play** - the app runs, then the game opens.

![Steam launch options](docs/img/steaming.png)

<details>
<summary>Advanced — run from source instead</summary>

If you cloned the repo and use `uv`, paste this into **Launch Options** instead:

```text
cmd /c "start /MIN /D C:\Your\Path\To\Forza-Horizon-DualSense-Python\src uv run python -m fhds.main" && %command%
```
</details>

---

## 🎚️ Tuning the feel

Every effect (brake force, ABS buzz, gear thump, rev limiter, etc.) can be tweaked or turned off from the **Settings page in the app** — no file editing needed. Changes apply on next launch.

> ⚠️ The rev limiter fires based on `rpm / max_rpm`, not a fixed RPM. Different cars hit redline at different ratios, so it may need per-car tweaking.

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `DualSense gamepad interface not found` | Controller not connected, or HidHide is hiding it — allowlist `python.exe`. |
| `No UDP packets yet` | Forza's Data Out is off, IP/port is wrong, Windows Firewall is blocking, or try changing the IP from `127.0.0.1` to `::1`. |
| Triggers feel weak | Raise `brake_max_force` / `throttle_max_force`, or lower the matching `curve`. |
| Triggers feel like a brick wall | Lower `brake_max_force` / `throttle_max_force`, or raise the matching `curve`. |
| Triggers feel stiff at a light press | Lower the baseline force, or raise the `curve`. |
| No vibration on gear shift | Car must be moving faster than 3 km/h and changing between valid gears. |
| Console window is blank after the startup pulse | Run from a terminal with `uv run python -m fhds.main --headless` to skip the TUI. |

## 🎮 DSX Support

I have integrated DSX (DualSenseX) support. Due to DSX limitations, you might not get the exact 1:1 experience, but I have done my best. A lower-fidelity version of the adaptive trigger effects is fully supported.
