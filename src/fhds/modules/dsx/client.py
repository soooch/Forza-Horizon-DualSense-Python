"""DSX (DualSenseX) UDP client.

Drop-in for DualSense at the set/open/close/connected boundary so the loop can
swap backends. Sends adaptive-trigger data to DSX over UDP instead of writing
HID directly; while active, DSX owns the controller and this never touches HID.

UDP is fire-and-forget — DSX sends no ack — so `connected` means "socket open",
not "DSX is listening". That's the most the transport allows.
